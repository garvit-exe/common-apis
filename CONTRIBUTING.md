## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Project Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to <garvitbudhiraja02@gmail.com>.


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](README.md#documentation) (or specify your documentation link).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new) and select the "Question" or "Help" template if available.
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (e.g., Node.js, npm, Python, specific library versions, operating system), depending on what seems relevant to your question.
- Clearly describe what you're trying to achieve and what's preventing you from doing so.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible, and other community members might also jump in to help!

### Reporting Bugs


#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](README.md#documentation). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?


#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <garvitbudhiraja02@gmail.com>.


We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for this project, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.


#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](README.md#documentation) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.


#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.


### Your First Code Contribution

Not sure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good first issue` or `help wanted` issues:

- [Good first issues](issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- [Help wanted issues](issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.

If you're new to the project or to open source, here's a general guide:

1.  **Fork the repository**: Use the "Fork" button on GitHub. This creates your own copy of the project.
2.  **Clone your fork**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/garvit-exe/common-apis.git
    cd PROJECT_NAME
    ```
3.  **Set up upstream remote**:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/garvit-exe/common-apis.git
    ```
4.  **Create a new branch**: Name it descriptively (e.g., `fix/login-bug` or `feat/new-button`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```
5.  **Make your changes**: Write your code and, if applicable, tests.
6.  **Test your changes**: Ensure all tests pass. If you added new features, add new tests.
    ```bash
    # Example: npm test OR pytest
    ```
7.  **Format and lint your code**: (Specify your project's tools if any, e.g., Prettier, ESLint, Black)
    ```bash
    # Example: npm run lint OR make lint
    ```
8.  **Commit your changes**: Follow the [Git Commit Messages](#git-commit-messages) styleguide.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add new cool feature"
    ```
9.  **Push to your fork**:
    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```
10. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**:
    *   Go to the original repository on GitHub.
    *   You should see a prompt to create a PR from your new branch.
    *   Fill out the PR template. Clearly describe your changes and reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").
    *   Ensure your PR passes any automated checks (CI/CD).
    *   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments based on feedback.

### Improving The Documentation

Good documentation is key to a successful project. We welcome any improvements to our documentation. This can include:

-   Correcting typos or grammatical errors.
-   Clarifying confusing sections.
-   Adding missing information or examples.
-   Improving the structure or navigation.

To contribute to the documentation:

1.  Follow the same process as for [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution) (fork, branch, edit, commit, PR).
2.  Documentation files are typically written in Markdown (`.md`) and can be found in the `/docs` directory or in the root of the project (e.g., `README.md`).
3.  When writing, try to adhere to the [Documentation Style](#documentation-style).
4.  Preview your changes to ensure they render correctly.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for our commit messages. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

A commit message should be structured as follows:
```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

**Allowed `<type>` values:**

-   `feat`: A new feature.
-   `fix`: A bug fix.
-   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
-   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
-   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
-   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
-   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
-   `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
-   `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
-   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files.

**Example:**
```bash
feat(api): add endpoint for user profiles

This commit introduces a new GET endpoint /users/{id}/profile
which returns the profile information for a given user.

Closes #42
```


**Rules for the subject line:**

-   Use the imperative, present tense: "add feature" not "added feature" nor "adds feature".
-   Don't capitalize the first letter.
-   No dot (.) at the end.

### Code Style

Consistency is key. Please try to follow the existing code style in the project.

-   **Formatting**: [Specify your formatter, e.g., Prettier, Black, or general guidelines like indentation (e.g., 2 spaces, 4 spaces, tabs)].
-   **Linting**: [Specify your linter, e.g., ESLint, Flake8, RuboCop]. We encourage running the linter before committing your changes.
    ```bash
    # Example: npm run lint OR make lint
    ```
-   **Comments**: Write clear and concise comments where necessary to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
-   **Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.

If the project has a specific style guide document or configuration files for linters/formatters (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `pyproject.toml`), please refer to them.

### Documentation Style

-   **Clarity and Conciseness**: Write clearly and to the point. Avoid jargon where possible, or explain it if necessary.
-   **Markdown**: Use Markdown for all documentation.
-   **Grammar and Spelling**: Ensure correct grammar and spelling.
-   **Examples**: Provide clear and runnable examples where appropriate.
-   **Headings**: Use appropriate heading levels (`#`, `##`, `###`) to structure the content logically.
